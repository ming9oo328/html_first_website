    <h2>Dog의 인구를 알아볼까요?</h2>
    <p>
        The dog is probably the most widely abundant large carnivoran living in the human environment. 
        In 2013, the estimated global dog population was between 700 million and 987 million. 
        About 20% of dogs live as pets in developed countries. In the developing world, dogs are more commonly feral 
        or communally owned, with pet dogs uncommon. Most of these dogs live their lives as scavengers and have never 
        been owned by humans, with one study showing their most common response when approached by strangers is to run 
        away (52%) or respond aggressively (11%). Little is known about these dogs, or the dogs in developed countries 
        that are feral, strays, or are in shelters because the great majority of modern research on dog cognition has 
        focused on pet dogs living in human homes.
