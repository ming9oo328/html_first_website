    <h2>Dog의 지능을 알아볼까요?</h2>
    <p>
        Dog intelligence is the dog's ability to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to 
        solve problems. Studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference and have advanced memory skills. 
        A study with Rico, a Border Collie, showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the 
        names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items immediately and four weeks 
        after the initial exposure. A study of another Border Collie, Chaser, documented his learning and memory capabilities. 
        He had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words. Dogs can read and react appropriately 
        to human body language such as gesturing and pointing and human voice commands.
